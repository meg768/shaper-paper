# Shaper Paper

**Reusable A4-based ShaperTape system — verified to work with Shaper Origin.**

This project demonstrates that you can scan, print and reuse genuine ShaperTape markers on regular A4 paper — without losing tracking or precision.

## Overview

Just for fun (and curiosity), I decided to test whether **Xerox copies** or **scanned/printed versions** of original ShaperTape would still work with the Shaper Origin.

**It works perfectly.**

This repo provides a ready-to-print PDF containing four A4 sheets of genuine ShaperTape markers.  
Each page contains enough “dominos” for most Origin projects.

## How It Was Made

1. **Original material:**  
   - Four A4 sheets covered with original ShaperTape (labeled A–D).  
   - All markers taken from the same ShaperTape roll.
2. **Scanning process:**  
   - Scanner: *Canon TS7450i*  
   - Mode: **Text**  
   - Resolution: **600 dpi**  
   - Scale: **100 % (actual size)**  
3. **PDF creation:**  
   - Combined all four scanned pages into a single PDF using macOS Preview.  
   - No compression or rescaling applied.
4. **Printing:**  
   - Printed on **matte self-adhesive A4 paper** (https://www.kjell.com/se/produkter/kontor/markning/etiketter/herma-sjalvhaftande-skrivarpapper-a4-25-pack-temporar-p25133). 
   - Alternatively: plain A4 + tape.  
   - Printer setting: **Scale = 100 %**, *no “fit to page”*.

## Results

- Origin recognized all dominos immediately (blue highlights).  
- Tracking remained completely stable — no “Lost Track” warnings.  
- Even slightly lower-contrast prints worked fine.  
- Works identically to original ShaperTape when scanned as a *New Scan*.

---

## Notes

- Each page (A–D) contains **unique** domino codes from a single original roll.  
- Don’t mix originals and copies in the same scan.  
- Keep scanning and printing at **exact 100 % scale** — no resizing.  
- Store your printed sheets flat and dust-free for best camera recognition.

## Usage

1. Place one or more printed A4 sheets around your workpiece.  
2. Run **New Scan** on Shaper Origin.  
3. Verify blue markers appear on screen.  
4. Cut as usual — enjoy your zero-cost digital ShaperTape.
