# Shaper Paper

**Reusable A4-based ShaperTape system — verified to work with Shaper Origin.**

This project demonstrates that you can scan, print and reuse genuine ShaperTape markers on regular A4 paper — without losing tracking or precision.

## 📄 Overview

Just for fun (and curiosity), I decided to test whether **Xerox copies** or **scanned/printed versions** of original ShaperTape would still work with the Shaper Origin.

**It works perfectly.**

This repo provides a ready-to-print PDF containing four A4 sheets of genuine ShaperTape markers.  
Each page contains enough “dominos” for most Origin projects.

## 🧩 How It Was Made

1. **Original material:**  
   - Four A4 sheets covered with original ShaperTape (labeled A–D).  
   - All markers taken from the same ShaperTape roll.

2. **Scanning process:**  
   - Scanner: *Canon TS7450i*  
   - Mode: **Text**  
   - Resolution: **600 dpi**  
   - Scale: **100 % (actual size)**  
   - Color: **Grayscale**  

3. **PDF creation:**  
   - Combined all four scanned pages into a single PDF using macOS Preview.  
   - No compression or rescaling applied.

4. **Printing:**  
   - Printed on **matte self-adhesive A4 paper** (Kjell & Co, Sweden).  
   - Alternatively: plain A4 + double-sided tape.  
   - Printer setting: **Scale = 100 %**, *no “fit to page”*.

## 🎯 Results

- Origin recognized all dominos immediately (blue highlights).  
- Tracking remained completely stable — no “Lost Track” warnings.  
- Even slightly lower-contrast prints worked fine.  
- Works identically to original ShaperTape when scanned as a *New Scan*.

## 🧠 Notes

- Each page (A–D) contains **unique** domino codes from a single original roll.  
- Don’t mix originals and copies in the same scan.  
- Keep scanning and printing at **exact 100 % scal**
